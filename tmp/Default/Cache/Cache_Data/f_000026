If you’re new to the trend, think of it as a deconstructed sushi roll. Loaded with sticky sushi rice, high-quality Ahi tuna and a bounty of fresh vegetables, this Hawaiian-inspired dish is quick, easy and delicious. If you’re looking to add heat, a little (or a lot) of sriracha is a great choice. ","instructions":"1. In a small bowl, add red onions, ½ cup apple cider vinegar, 2 teaspoons sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix to combine, cover and let sit for at least 30 minutes.\n\n2. In another bowl, combine ahi tuna and soy sauce. Let sit for 30 minutes.  \n\n3. Place rice in a bowl filled with cold water and wash to remove excess starch. Transfer to a mesh strainer and drain.\n\n4. Put cleaned rice in a medium-sized pot with 1 cup of water. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Keep covered, remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes.\n\n5. While rice is cooking, combine 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 ½ teaspoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 seaweed snack in a small paper over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar and salt have dissolved (do not let mixture boil). Remove from heat, discard seaweed snack and let cool at room temperature.\n\n6. Remove lid from rice and fluff with a fork. Divide rice between two bowls. Pour vinegar mixture over each bowl of rice, gently fold to incorporate. \n\n7. Top each bowl of rice with 4 slices of marinated ahi tuna, avocado, cucumber, mango, pickled onions, green onions, radishes and 2 seaweed snack sheets.\n\n8.
